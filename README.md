This project aims to predict whether a customer is happy/unhappy based on their feedback in a logisitics and delivery context. Using survery responses covering delivery experience, courier satisfication, order fulfillment, and app usability, I apply classification models to uncover key drivers of customer satisfication. The project explores data through EDA, builds and tunes multiple machine learning models and evaluates them based on F1-score to guide operational improvements and enhance customer experience.
